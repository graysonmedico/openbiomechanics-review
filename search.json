To give you a benchmark:\nAverage High School: ~600-700 deg/s\nElite/Pro: ~700-900+ deg/s\nY-Axis: Pitch Velocity (mph)\nWhat it is: The speed of the baseball at release.\nWhy we compare them: If the “speed theory” were 100% true, we would see a perfect diagonal line—every pitcher with fast hips would throw hard, and every pitcher with slow hips would throw soft."

    "title": "The Analysis: Does Arm Slot Affect Health?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "“Dropping your arm slot saves your elbow.” This chart investigates one of the most common debates in pitching: Does throwing “over the top” create more stress than throwing “sidearm”? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy analyzing the relationship between arm angle and torque efficiency, we can see if one style of throwing is inherently safer than another.\n\nThe Variables\nX-Axis: Arm Slot (Degrees)\nWhat it is: The angle of the forearm relative to the ground at release.\nHow to read it:\nLower numbers (&lt; 30°): Sidearm or Low-3/4 slot.\nHigher numbers (&gt; 50°): Over-the-top or High-3/4 slot.\nY-Axis: Torque Efficiency (Nm per MPH)\nWhat it is: This is a “fairness” metric. Instead of looking at raw stress, we look at Stress Cost per MPH. It answers: “How much torque does this pitcher ‘pay’ to generate 1 MPH of velocity?”\nWhy we use it: A pitcher throwing 95 mph will naturally have more raw torque than someone throwing 80 mph. By dividing torque by velocity, we can compare the mechanical efficiency of different arm slots on a level playing field.\n\n\nHow to Read This Graph\nThe Flat Line (R ≈ 0): You will notice the trend line is almost perfectly horizontal (R = 0.02). This is a critical finding. It indicates zero correlation between arm slot and stress efficiency.\nThe Scatter: Notice that the red dots (High Stress/Low Efficiency) and blue dots (Low Stress/High Efficiency) are scattered evenly across the graph. You can find “efficient” pitchers at a low arm slot and at a high arm slot.\n\n\nThe Takeaway\nYour arm slot does not determine your injury risk. The data suggests that changing a pitcher’s arm slot simply to “reduce stress” is likely ineffective. A sidearmer pays the same “tax” on their elbow as an over-the-top thrower. Stress is determined by velocity and timing (how the hips and trunk sequence), not by the height of the hand at release."

When a pitcher strides too far, their hips can get “locked out,” preventing them from rotating quickly and killing their power.\nThe “Short-Striders”: Dots on the far left represent pitchers who cut their delivery short.

In pitching, increasing velocity (“adding gas”) often comes with increased mechanical demands on the arm. A simple and transparent way to quantify that tradeoff is to measure how strongly pitch speed co-varies with a widely used proxy for medial elbow loading.\nWhy this matters: coaches and athletes frequently debate whether throwing harder necessarily means “more stress.” This visualization summarizes the population-level trend while also showing the individual variability that exists at the same velocity."

    "text": "Why Elbow Varus Moment?\nThe elbow varus moment is commonly used in pitching biomechanics as a mechanical proxy for the internal torques that resist elbow valgus loading during the throwing motion. In practical terms, higher values are interpreted as greater load demand at the elbow, especially during the high-stress portion of the acceleration phase. While it is not a direct measurement of ligament strain (e.g., UCL strain), it is a standard, interpretable metric for comparing relative elbow loading across pitches and athletes in laboratory-style biomechanics datasets.\nThis makes it a strong candidate for correlating with velocity because:\n\nIt is a direct output of inverse dynamics calculations from motion-capture + force data.\nIt is tightly connected to the throwing arm’s peak load window (where injury risk discussions tend to focus).\nIt serves as a widely recognized “stress” variable that can be communicated clearly to coaches, players, and evaluators."

    "text": "Interpreting This Figure (R = 0.47)\nThe reported correlation in this figure is:\nR = 0.47\nThis indicates a moderate positive relationship: as pitch velocity increases, elbow varus moment tends to increase as well. Importantly, correlation reflects association—not causation—but the direction is biomechanically consistent with the idea that higher ball speeds generally require higher angular velocities and forces somewhere in the kinetic chain, which can elevate joint moments at the elbow.\nSo, pitch speed alone accounts for roughly ~22% of the variation in elbow varus moment in this sample. That means velocity is meaningfully related to elbow loading, but it is not the whole story.\n\nWhat the spread of points implies\nEven with a positive trend, the scatter shows substantial overlap: - Pitches thrown at similar velocities can show very different elbow moments - Some pitchers/pitches appear to achieve a given velocity with lower-than-typical elbow loading, while others show higher-than-typical loading\nThat pattern is valuable: it suggests that beyond velocity, elbow loading is also influenced by factors such as: - sequencing/timing (proximal-to-distal transfer) - trunk and pelvis contributions - lead-leg braking dynamics - arm path and joint positions at key events (e.g., foot plant / MER) - individual anthropometrics and movement solutions\nIn player development terms, this supports a professional, nuanced conclusion:\n\nThrowing harder is generally associated with higher elbow load demand, but mechanical efficiency and kinetic chain strategy can shift how “expensive” a given velocity is at the elbow."
