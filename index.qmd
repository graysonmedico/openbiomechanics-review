## How the Data is Captured

This project analyzes biomechanics data from the **OpenBiomechanics Project**, an open-source initiative by Driveline Baseball.

The data is captured in their motion capture lab using high-speed cameras and computer vision to track an athlete's body. This allows for sub-millimeter accuracy in tracking joint centers and skeletal movement.

### Watch the Process
Below is a video directly from the Driveline lab showing how the capture system works:

## About This Site

I built this site to correlate **body kinematics** (how they move) with **pitch metrics** (how the ball flies).

Navigate to the analysis tabs to see:
* **Hip-Shoulder Separation:** Does stretching the core lead to more velocity?
* **Arm Stress:** Which mechanics put the most torque on the elbow?
