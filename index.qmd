**The LONGER you stride the HARDER you throw** - Stride Fallacy 
<br>
<br>

**Slot** - Slot Efficiency
<br>
<br>

**Rotate your hips fast to throw harder** - The Hips Do Lie
<br>
<br>

**The HARDER you throw the MORE stress on the elbow** - Elbow Torque

## How the Data is Captured

This project analyzes biomechanics data from the **OpenBiomechanics Project**, an open-source initiative by Driveline Baseball.

The data is captured in their motion capture lab using high-speed cameras and computer vision to track an athlete's body. This allows for sub-millimeter accuracy in tracking joint centers and skeletal movement.

### Watch the Process
Below is a video directly from the Driveline lab showing how the capture system works:

## Examining this Data Set
<br>
100 pitchers from highschool, college, and professional baseball. Ranging from **70 mph** to **94 mph**
