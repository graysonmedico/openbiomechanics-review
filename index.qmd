## How the Data is Captured

This project analyzes biomechanics data from the **OpenBiomechanics Project**, an open-source initiative by Driveline Baseball.

The data is captured in their motion capture lab using high-speed cameras and computer vision to track an athlete's body. This allows for sub-millimeter accuracy in tracking joint centers and skeletal movement.

### Watch the Process
Below is a video directly from the Driveline lab showing how the capture system works:
